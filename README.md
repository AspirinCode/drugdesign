drugdesign
==========
came about an initiative to develop a collaborative project 
in drug design area. 
Nowadays, this project allows to perform virtual screening
protein and compounds. It concede a virtual screening of flexible 
receptors that can be both experimental (PDB database) and 
theoretical (molecular dynamics simulation)

Instalation 
===========
It is necessary to install the follow softwares:
1) AutoDock Vina - http://vina.scripps.edu/
2) MGLTools-1.5.6 - http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads

How to run a Virtual Screening?
===============================
After installing all softwares decribed in Instalation section (see above),
seven steps are necessary to run Virtual Screening.

1) Download compounds from ZINC Database: http://zinc.docking.org/
2) Preparing config.ini file
3) Extract the compounds from ZINC Database
4) Preparing ligands
5) Preparing receptors
6) Preparing box of Auto Vina
7) Running the Virtual Screening
